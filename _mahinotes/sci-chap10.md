{: #spherical-mirrors }
- Number of videos: 4
- Total Duration: ~ 17 minutes 35 seconds

5.) Spherical Mirror Intro & Definitions
- Video Duration: ~ 3 minute 38 seconds
- Covers: 2nd and 3rd page of chapter 10 NCERT Science Book
- Actions: 
	1. Write definition of Spherical Mirror in your notebook
	2. Write definition of Concave Mirror in your notebook
	3. Write definition of Convex Mirror in your notebook
	4. Draw and label Pole, Centre of Curvature, Principal Axis, Radius of Curvature, Focal point/Principal Focus and Aperture in your notebook for both concave and convex mirrors.
	5. Write one line dfinition for each
		- Pole
		- Centre of Curvature
		- Principal Axis
		- Radius of Curvature
		- Focal point/Principal Focus
		- Aperture

6.) Concave Mirror - Principal Focus, Focal Point
- Video Duration: ~ 5 minute 32 seconds
- Covers: 3rd and 4th page of chapter 10 NCERT Science Book
- Actions: 
	1. Makes notes of formula for _focal length_ of concave mirror.
		- Radius of Curvature of Spherical Mirror = CP
		- Centre of Curvature to Principal Focus = CF
		- Principal Focus to Pole or *Focal Length* = FP
	2. CP = CF + FP
	3. CP = 2 * FP
	4. *FP = CP / 2*
